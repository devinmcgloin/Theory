# Papers and Ideas

The vast bulk of these papers came from the [papers-we-love repository](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love), they hold meetups which are excellent. Head over there to see if there is one in your area.

Papers in the worrydream directory come from Bret Victor's excellent [references page](http://worrydream.com/refs/).

I'm going over them, reading and adding notes as well as adding interesting papers I find.

Feel free to share and add comments / push changes.

The same papers are hosted on my own [references page](http://refs.devinmcgloin.com).
