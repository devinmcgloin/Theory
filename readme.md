# Papers and Ideas

The vast bulk of these papers came from the [papers-we-love repository](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love), they hold meetups which are excellent. Head over there to see if there is one in your area.

I'm going over them, reading and adding notes as well as adding interesting papers I find.

Feel free to share and add comments / push changes.
