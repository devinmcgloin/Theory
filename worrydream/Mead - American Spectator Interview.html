  <h2 class="c3"><b>The Spectator Interview</b><br /></h2>

  <p class="q">Once upon a time, Caltech's Richard Feynman, Nobel Laureate leader 
  of the last great generation
  of physicists, threw down the gauntlet to anyone rash enough to doubt the fundamental
  weirdness, the quark-boson-muon-strewn amusement park landscape of late 20th-century
  quantum physics. "Things on a very small scale behave like nothing you have direct
  experience about. They do not behave like waves. They do not behave like particles
  ...or like anything you have ever seen. Get used to it."</p>

  <p class="q">Carver Mead never has.</p>

  <p class="q">As Gordon and Betty Moore Professor of Engineering and Applied
  Science at Caltech, Mead was Feynman's student, colleague and collaborator, as well as
  Silicon Valley's physicist in residence and leading intellectual. He picks up Feynman's
  challenge in a new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262632608">Collective Electrodynamics</a> (MIT Press), declaring that a
  physics that does not make sense, that defies human intuition, is obscurantist: It
  balks thought and intellectual progress. It blocks the light of the age.</p>

  <p class="q">In a career of nearly half a century that has made him the microchip
  industry's most influential and creative academic, Mead is best known as inventor of a
  crucial high frequency transistor, author of dominant chip design techniques,
  progenitor of the movement toward dynamically programmable logic chips, and most
  recently developer of radical advances in machine-aided perception. In 1999, he won the
  half-million dollar MIT-Lemelson award for innovation. But any list of accomplishments
  underrates Mead's role as the most important practical scientist of the late twentieth
  century. He is now emerging as the boldest theoretical physicist of the
  twenty-first.</p>

  <p class="q">Perhaps more than any other man, Mead has spent his professional
  life working on intimate terms with matter at the atomic and subatomic levels. He spent
  ten years exploring the intricacies of quantum tunneling and tunnel diodes, the first
  electronic devices based on an exclusively quantum process. Unlike most analysts, Mead
  does not regard tunneling as a mysterious movement of particles through impenetrable
  barriers. He sees it as an intelligible wave phenomenon, resembling on the microcosmic
  level the movement of radio waves through walls.</p>

  <p class="q">While pursuing these researches, Mead responded to a query from
  Intel-founder Gordon Moore about the possible size of microelectronic devices. Mead
  provided the empirical analysis behind Moore's law (predicting a doubling of computer
  power every 18 months). When single chips held only tens of transistors, he showed that
  in due course tens of millions would be feasible. In collaboration with Feynman, Mead
  also developed a definitive course on the physics of computation that has yielded a
  minor industry of books and tapes and imitators. After a year in Coblenz with
  Nobel-prize winning physicist-turned-biologist Max Delbruck, Mead pursued a lifelong
  multi-disciplinary interest in the physics of neural systems. His researches on the
  human retina led to his invention of the revolutionary Foveon camera that achieves
  resolution and verisimilitude in cheap silicon superior to the best silver halide
  films. His study of the cochlea has informed the creation of unique directional hearing
  aids, produced by Sonic Innovations of Salt Lake City.</p>

  <p class="q">Now, in the opening years of the new millennium, Mead believes that
  it is time to clear up the philosophical and practical confusion of contemporary
  physics. He revisits the debate between the Copenhagen interpreters of quantum
  physics--Niels Bohr, Alfred Heisenberg, John von Neumann, Richard Feynman--and the
  skeptics, principally Albert Einstein and Erwin Schrodinger. Pointing to a series of
  experiments from the world of microelectronic and photonic technology that still lay in
  the future when Bohr prevailed in his debates with Einstein, Mead rectifies an
  injustice and awards a posthumous victory to Einstein.</p>

  <p class="q">During a lifetime in the trenches of the semiconductor industry,
  Mead developed a growing uneasiness about the "standard model" that supposedly governed
  his field. Mead did not see his electrons and photons as random or incoherent. He
  regarded the concept of the "point particle" as an otiose legacy from the classical
  era. Early photodetectors or Geiger counters may have provided both visual and auditory
  testimony that photons were point particles, but the particulate click coarsely
  concealed a measurable wave.</p>

  <p class="q">Central to Mead's rescue project are a series of discoveries
  inconsistent with the prevailing conceptions of quantum mechanics. One was the laser.
  As late as 1956, Bohr and von Neumann, the paragons of quantum theory, arrived at the
  Columbia laboratories of Charles Townes, who was in the process of describing his
  invention. With the transistor, the laser is one of the most important inventions of
  the twentieth century. Designed into every CD player and long distance telephone
  connection, lasers today are manufactured by the billions. At the heart of laser action
  is perfect alignment of the crests and troughs of myriad waves of light. Their location
  and momentum must be theoretically knowable. But this violates the holiest canon of
  Copenhagen theory: Heisenberg Uncertainty. Bohr and von Neumann proved to be true
  believers in Heisenberg's rule. Both denied that the laser was possible. When Townes
  showed them one in operation, they retreated artfully.</p>

  <p class="q">In Collective Electrodynamics, Mead cites nine other experimental
  discoveries, from superconductive currents to masers, to Bose-Einstein condensates
  predicted by Einstein but not demonstrated until 1995. These discoveries of
  large-scale, coherent quantum phenomena all occurred after Bohr's triumph over
  Einstein.</p>

  <p class="q">Mead does not banish the mystery from science. He declares that
  physics is vastly farther away from a fundamental grasp of nature than many of the
  current exponents of a grand unified theory imagine. But he believes he can explain the
  nature of the famous mysteries of quantum science, from the two slit experiment where
  "particles" go through two holes at once to the perplexities of "entanglement," where
  action on a quantum entity at one point of the universe can affect entities at other
  remote points at speeds faster than the speed of light. In his new interpretation,
  quantum physics is united with electromagnetism and the venerable Maxwell Equations are
  found to be dispensable.</p>

  <p class="q">But Mead does not bow humbly before all of Einstein's conceptions.
  He dismisses the photoelectric effect as an artifact of early twentieth century
  apparatus. He also believes that General Relativity conceals more than it illuminates
  about gravitation ."All the important details are smoothed over by Einstein's curvature
  of space time." Gravity remains shrouded in mystery.</p>

  <p class="q">We arrived at Mead's house in Woodside, high above Silicon Valley.
  It is a modernistic aerie with hardwood floors and cathedral ceilings, perched on the
  precipitous slopes of the Los Altos Hills. The dense stands of surrounding redwood
  trees, concealing the valley below, make for a cathedral outside as well as in. We
  found him eager to discuss his theories and his Promethean book. A short lithe man with
  a small beard and a taste for undulatory rainbow shirts, Carver speaks with quiet
  authority, quirky humor and a gentle but inexorable persuasiveness. He conveys the
  sense that during his fifty years of immersion in technology he has made electrons and
  photons his friends, and he knows they would never indulge in the outrageous,
  irrational behavior ascribed to them by physicists. In the process, he is also
  implicitly coming to the defense of reason, science, history, culture, human dignity
  and free will.</p>
  
  <p class="separator">&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p class="q2">THE AMERICAN SPECTATOR: You open your new book with a dramatic
  statement. "It is my firm belief that the last seven decades of the twentieth will be
  characterized in history as the dark ages of theoretical physics." Can you explain
  that?</p>

  <p><b>CARVER MEAD:</b> Modern science began with mechanics, and in some
  ways we are still captive to its ideas and images. Newton's success in deriving the
  planetary orbits from his law of gravitation became the paradigm. To Niels Bohr early
  in this century, when the quantum theory was invented, the atom was thought of as a
  miniature solar system, with a nucleus as the sun and electrons as planets. Then, out
  of the struggle to understand the atom came quantum mechanics. Bohr gathered the early
  contributors into a clan in Copenhagen, and he encouraged them to believe that they
  were developing the ultimate theory of nature. He argued vigorously against any
  opponents.</p>

  <p class="q2">Among whom was Albert Einstein. He had already scored a triumph
  with relativity theory by that time. But the history books tells us that he lost the
  argument with Bohr. Can you explain their dispute? And why do you now award the verdict
  to Einstein?</p>

  <p>Bohr insisted that the laws of physics, at the most fundamental
  level, are statistical in nature. Physical reality consisted at its base of statistical
  probabilities governed by Heisenberg uncertainty. Bohr saw these uncertainties as
  intrinsic to reality itself, and he and his followers enshrined that belief in what
  came to be known as the "Copenhagen interpretation" of quantum theory. By contrast
  Einstein famously argued that "the Lord does not throw dice." He believed that
  electrons were real and he wrote, in 1949, that he was "firmly convinced that the
  essentially statistical character of contemporary quantum theory is solely to be
  ascribed to the fact that this [theory] operates with an incomplete description of
  physical systems."</p>

  <p class="q2">So how did Bohr and the others come to think of nature as
  ultimately random, discontinuous?</p>

  <p>They took the limitations of their cumbersome experiments as
  evidence for the nature of reality. Using the crude equipment of the early twentieth
  century, it's amazing that physicists could get any significant results at all. So I
  have enormous respect for the people who were able to discern anything profound from
  these experiments. If they had known about the coherent quantum systems that are
  commonplace today, they wouldn't have thought of using statistics as the foundation for
  physics.</p>

  <p class="q2">Statistics in this sense means what?</p>

  <p>That an electron is either here, or there, or some other place, and
  all you can know is the probability that it is in one place or the other. Bohr ended up
  saying that the only statements you can make at the fundamental level are statistical.
  You cannot grasp the reality itself, only probabilities related to it. They really,
  really, wanted to have the last word, and the only word they had was statistical. So
  they made their limitations the last word, saying, "Okay, the only knowledge that there
  is down deed is statistical knowledge. That's all we can know." That's a very dangerous
  thing to say. It is always possible to gain a deeper understanding as time progresses.
  But they carried the day.</p>

  <p class="q2">What about Schrodinger? Back in the 1920s, didn't he say
  something like what you are saying now?</p>

  <p>That's right. He felt that he could develop a wave theory of the
  electron that could explain how all this worked. But Bohr was more into "principles":
  the uncertainty principle, the exclusion principle--this, that, and the other. He was
  very much into the postulational mode. But Schrodinger thought that a continuum theory
  of the electron could be successful. So he went to Copenhagen to work with Bohr. He
  felt that it was a matter of getting a "political" consensus; you know, this is a
  historic thing that is happening. But whenever Schrodinger tried to talk, Bohr would
  raise his voice and bring up all these counter-examples. Basically he shouted him
  down.</p>

  <p class="q2">It sounds like vanity.</p>

  <p>Of course. It was a period when physics was full of huge egos. It
  was still going on when I got into the field. But it doesn't make sense, and it isn't
  the way science works in the long run. It may forestall people from doing sensible work
  for a long time, which is what happened. They ended up derailing conceptual physics for
  the next 70 years.</p>

  <p class="q2">Let's take a break--tell us a little about how you came to
  physics.</p>

  <p>I was fortunate enough to get introduced to electricity at an early
  age, and I fell in love with it. By the age of six I was comfortable with all kinds of
  electrical phenomena.</p>

  <p class="q2">So practice took precedence over theory?</p>

  <p>Yes, but I wanted the theory to understand it. And that took time.
  But I never lost that intuitive grasp from having actually worked with it.</p>

  <p class="q2">Tell us about your early life.</p>

  <p>I was born in 1934 and grew up in California. We lived in a place
  called Big Creek, halfway between Yosemite and King's Canyon, up in the Sierra country.
  A lot of snow falls on those mountains during the winter, and in the spring it runs
  off. Around the turn of the century they built a series of dams and power plants up
  there, the Big Creek Project. As late as World War II, it supplied about 90 percent of
  the power for Los Angeles. It was a marvelous way to grow up because I learned about
  electricity just by being around it. It was everywhere. My father worked in the power
  plant, and he taught me as best he could.</p>

  <p class="q2">You lived near the plant?</p>

  <p>We had these places called camps, which were a group of homes around
  the power plant. Originally they were tents for the construction workers. When I was
  12, a guy who was a ham radio operator moved in. My uncle had gotten me started on
  radio, but then he went off to the war--he worked in Britain on the radar project.
  Anyway, this guy had a background in electronics and he was willing to teach me what he
  knew. That was just as the war was ending, so there was all this war-surplus
  electronics on the market, dirt cheap. With the little bits of money that a kid could
  earn, I could buy piles of electronics, and try to figure out what they were and why
  they were that way and how I could modify them. That was how I got my start--you could
  afford to do experiments, because the stuff was so cheap. You could build up equipment
  and try things, just to see what happened.</p>

  <p class="q2">Where did you go to school?</p>

  <p>Between two of the camps, way back in the woods, we had a little
  school. Twenty kids for all eight grades. There was one teacher through 4th grade and
  then it became a two-teacher school. My grandmother lived in Fresno in the
  CentralValley. They had a better high school, so I lived with her and went to high
  school there. Then I interviewed to go to Caltech and I remained there for my whole
  career.</p>

  <p class="q2">What about the power plant?</p>

  <p>Oh, there were things in the power plant that were just awesome. In
  the generator there's this big wheel going around with these coils of wire, and this
  cascading water coming down two thousand feet through these great pipes and rushing
  through turbines. On the other side, there are these one-inch diameter cables, going
  down to Los Angeles. As a kid, I would watch them bring a new unit on line. The
  generator has huge inertia, but almost no friction, so you have to be really careful.
  You let a little water through and the rotation accelerates. Its speed comes up and up,
  governed by this instrument called a syncroscope that looks at the relative phase
  [timing of the troughs and crests of the wave of electricity] on the grid, and the
  voltage from the generator. Nobody ever gets those phases exactly right, but if you
  miss by much, the whole power plant goes boom--the difference in phase is enough to
  shear off the huge bolts, six inches in diameter, that bind the generator to the floor
  of the power plant. So electricity may be invisible, but it is powerful stuff; it's not
  invisible really. It's just invisible in the way we normally look at things.</p>

  <p class="q2">So early on you knew that electrons were real.</p>

  <p>The electrons were real, the voltages were real, the phase of the
  sine-wave was real, the current was real. These were real things. They were just as
  real as the water going down through the pipes. You listen to the technology, and you
  know that these things are totally real, and totally intuitive.</p>

  <p class="q2">But they're also waves, right? Then what are they waving in?</p>

  <p>It's interesting, isn't it? That has hung people up ever since the
  time of Clerk Maxwell, and it's the missing piece of intuition that we need to develop
  in young people. The electron isn't the disturbance of something else. It is its own
  thing. The electron is the thing that's wiggling, and the wave is the electron. It is
  its own medium. You don't need something for it to be in, because if you did it would
  be buffeted about and all messed up. So the only pure way to have a wave is for it to
  be its own medium. The electron isn't something that has a fixed physical shape. Waves
  propagate outwards, and they can be large or small. That's what waves do.</p>

  <p class="q2">So how big is an electron?</p>

  <p>It expands to fit the container it's in. That may be a positive
  charge that's attracting it--a hydrogen atom--or the walls of a conductor. A piece of
  wire is a container for electrons. They simply fill out the piece of wire. That's what
  all waves do. If you try to gather them into a smaller space, the energy level goes up.
  That's what these Copenhagen guys call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. But
  there's nothing uncertain about it. It's just a property of waves. Confine them, and
  you have more wavelengths in a given space, and that means a higher frequency and
  higher energy. But a quantum wave also tends to go to the state of lowest energy, so it
  will expand as long as you let it. You can make an electron that's ten feet across,
  there's no problem with that. It's its own medium, right? And it gets to be less and
  less dense as you let it expand. People regularly do experiments with neutrons that are
  a foot across.</p>

  <p class="q2">A ten-foot electron! Amazing.</p>

  <p>It could be a mile. The electrons in my superconducting magnet are
  that long.</p>

  <p class="q2">A mile-long electron! That alters our picture of the world--most
  people's minds think about atoms as tiny solar systems.</p>

  <p>Right, that's what I was brought up on--this little grain of
  something. Now it's true that if you take a proton and you put it together with an
  electron, you get something that we call a hydrogen atom. But what that is, in fact, is
  a self-consistent solution of the two waves interacting with each other. They want to
  be close together because one's positive and the other is negative, and when they get
  closer that makes the energy lower. But if they get too close they wiggle too much and
  that makes the energy higher. So there's a place where they are just right, and that's
  what determines the size of the hydrogen atom. And that optimum is a self-consistent
  solution of the Schrodinger equation.</p>

  <p class="q2">So much for the idea of the quantum world as microscopic...</p>

  <p>Bohr and his followers had this notion that you got to the quantum
  world only when things were very small. Well, that's because the only thing they knew
  that exhibited quantum characteristics was an atom. They said, "Well, an atom is so
  small, we'll never see one." Now, it turns out, people have put atoms in cavities and
  you can see a single atom perfectly well. That experiment has been done many times now.
  In fact, if you do it properly, you can make atoms totally coherent. Do that with a lot
  of them, and you get Bose-Einstein condensate--a bunch of atoms in phase that act like
  one big matter wave. It was first demonstrated in 1995 by Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman
  in Colorado.</p>

  <p class="q2">The early experiments that dealt with things like black-body
  radiation and light passing though double slits--couldn't they detect those
  effects?</p>

  <p>The experiments on which the conceptual foundations of quantum
  mechanics were based were extremely crude by modern standards. The detectors 
  available--Geiger counters, cloud chambers, and photographic film--had a high 
  degree of randomness
  built in, and, by their very nature, could register only statistical results. The
  atomic sources were similarly constrained--large ensembles of atoms, with no mechanism
  for achieving phase coherence. Understandably, the experiments that could be imagined
  were all of a statistical sort.</p>

  <p class="q2">The most famous of those experiments involved a "single" photon
  that somehow succeeded in going through two holes at once.</p>

  <p>That uses a point-particle model for the "photon"--a little bullet
  carrying energy. If you define the problem this way, of course, you get nonsense.
  Garbage in, garbage out.</p>

  <p class="q2">So how should we think of a photon?</p>

  <p>John Cramer at the University of Washington was one of the first to
  describe it as a transaction between two atoms. At the end of his book, Schrodinger's
  Kittens and the Search for Reality, John Gribbin gives a nice overview of Cramer's
  interpretation and says that "with any luck at all it will supersede the Copenhagen
  interpretation as the standard way of thinking about quantum physics for the next
  generation of scientists."</p>

  <p class="q2">So that transaction is itself a wave?</p>

  <p>The field that describes that transaction is a wave, that's
  right.</p>

  <p class="q2">So how about "Schrodinger's cat"--the thought experiment he
  proposed to illustrate the impossible conundrum of quantum theory. The cat is in a
  closed box, with a quantum-based trigger that either does or does not release poison.
  Gribbin summarizes the standard Copenhagen view of the situation: "Neither of the two
  possibilities has any reality unless it is observed." So is the cat dead or alive? The
  standard quantum-theory answer--we're quoting Gribbin again--would be: "The cat has
  neither been killed nor not been killed until we look inside the box to see what
  happened." In other words, reality is observer-dependent.</p>

  <p>That is probably the biggest misconception that has come out of the
  Copenhagen view. The idea that the observation of some event makes it somehow more
  "real" became entrenched in the philosophy of quantum mechanics, and, like the other
  misconceptions, is said to be confirmed by experiment. Even the slightest reflection
  will show how silly it is. An observer is an assembly of atoms. What is different about
  the observer's atoms from those of any other object? What if the data are taken by
  computer? Do the events not happen until the scientist gets home from vacation and
  looks at the printout? It is ludicrous!</p>

  <p class="q2">Gribbin goes on to describe an experiment with entangled
  photons, which shows quantum entities affecting one another at long distances with no
  passage of time. He says this "proves that there is no underlying reality to the
  world."</p>

  <p>That is the experiment proposed by John Bell, the late Irish
  physicist, and done in its most definitive form by John Clauser--I'm currently in
  discussion with him about his fascinating findings. But the results say nothing
  whatsoever about what is and is not real.</p>

  <p class="q2">In your book, you ambitiously redraw the boundaries of physics.
  In the "dark age" of the last 70 years, you say, a fundamental distinction was drawn
  between classical physics--mechanics, electricity and magnetism-and modem physics,
  consisting of quantum theory and relativity. Bohr connected the two with his
  "correspondence principle." What was that?</p>

  <p>That was one of the big mistakes they made. They wanted the quantum
  domain to approximate the classical Newtonian world. And it simply doesn't. But Bohr
  believed that if you picked a limit where there are enough wavelengths, everything
  would average out to the same result you get from Newtonian physics.</p>

  <p class="q2">So by "correspondence," he meant a correspondence between the
  quantum world and the larger Newtonian world?</p>

  <p>Yes. And that was the wrong assumption. When you get to coherent
  quantum systems, they don't have a Newtonian limit at all. Coherent quantum systems
  "scale" in a way that is entirely different.</p>

  <p class="q2">You proposed dividing physics into "coherent" and "incoherent"
  systems. What's the difference?</p>

  <p>Okay. The quantum world is a world of waves, not particles. So we
  have to think of electron waves and proton waves and so on. Matter is "incoherent" when
  all its waves have a different wavelength, implying a different momentum. On the other
  hand, if you take a pure quantum system--the electrons in a superconducting magnet, or
  the atoms in a laser--they are all in phase with one another, and they demonstrate the
  wave nature of matter on a large scale. Then you can see quite visibly what matter is
  down at its heart.</p>

  <p class="q2">Perhaps we can compare it to water in a bathtub. If you
  "reinforce" the bath water at the right moment, a big wave will suddenly slosh out onto
  the floor. That is the macro equivalent of what you are describing. But when the little
  wavelets lap against one another, then not much happens--incoherence, in other words.
  is that right?</p>

  <p>That's right. In the coherent system, the waves are all in phase.
  But now, instead of water, let's think of something solid, say a billiard ball. A
  billiard ball is an incoherent mixture of lots of little matter "waves" that are
  interfering with one another all the time.</p>

  <p class="q2">But to our everyday understanding, on the "macro" level, a
  billiard ball is also "coherent" in the usual sense of that word. It obeys Newton's
  laws, for example. Throw it with a certain velocity and we can predict where it will
  land.</p>

  <p>Right, but that is a different sense of the word. As I describe
  them, coherent and incoherent systems are dominated by different sets of physical laws.
  With the incoherent systems that we see all around us, time is one-directional. And
  things that come apart don't spontaneously come together again. And the inertia--of the
  billiard ball, for example--increases linearly with the number of atoms. With coherent
  systems, on the other hand, time is two-directional, and inertia increases with the
  square of the number of elements. In a superconducting magnet, the electron inertia
  increases with the square of the number of electrons. That's foreign to Newtonian
  thinking, which is why Feynman had trouble with it. A coherent system is not more real,
  but it is much more pure and fundamental.</p>

  <p class="q2">Can we finesse this business about time going backwards and
  forwards? Understanding quantum physics is hard enough as it is! When Bohr proposed
  the correspondence principle, he wanted to keep a single set of laws: "As above, so
  below." And yes, in the microcosm, when things are jumbled up and "incoherent," it does
  approximate the physics of the macro-world. But under appropriate conditions--what you
  term coherence--the micro-world seems to operate in a quite different way?</p>

  <p>Right--Bohr put his foot on the wrong stone, the Newtonian side
  rather than the quantum side. The underlying reason is that Newtonian physics was
  phrased in terms of things like position and momentum and force which are all
  characteristics of particles. Bohr was wedded to particles.</p>

  <p class="q2">Are coherence and incoherence absolutes--can something be "a
  little bit pregnant?"</p>

  <p>Yes, it can be. Light from an ordinary fluorescent bulb has a
  certain amount of coherence, but light from incandescent bulbs has almost none. With
  coherence, all the waves have a common phase. When they're out of phase you get all
  these fringes and interference patterns.</p>

  <p class="q2">"Coherence" seems comparable to electricity--it has existed
  forever, and we could see it in the sky as lightning but only in the nineteenth century
  were we able to harness it. And only recently have we been able to harness coherent
  phenomena.</p>

  <p>Right. And once we have harnessed them in the laboratory, and begin
  to understand them, we can start to see them in the universe around us. There are
  increasing indications that many of the objects in the universe have coherent things
  going on in them. There are known to be masers in the atmospheres of some stars. It's
  now thought that a lot of the beaming of pulsars has to do with laser-like action.
  That's just surmised from the actions of these very mysterious objects--mysterious
  within the normal realm of incoherent physics. The universe is probably full of
  coherent physics.</p>

  <p class="q2">That brings us back to Einstein--experimental results continue
  to vindicate his viewpoint, no?</p>

  <p>The Bose-Einstein condensate, for example, or the quantum hall
  effect, or the super conducting quantum interference device--I list ten of them in my
  book, beginning in the mid-1930s and going up through 1995. Not many of your readers
  will have heard of them. But most people know what lasers and superconductors are, and
  they demonstrate nature acting in ways that Bohr and Heisenberg did not anticipate--a
  coherent state. Unfortunately, it was not until the 1960s that those results became
  widely known. So Einstein didn't have that information. He predicted coherent
  phenomena, but he didn't have a single example that he could actually get his hands
  on.</p>

  <p class="q2">So orthodoxy won the day.</p>

  <p>And after Bohr defeated Einstein, nobody else would take on the
  argument. Because if they put Einstein under, think what they would do to you.</p>

  <p class="q2">And yet it all turned on some very open questions...</p>

  <p>Einstein's basic point was that unpredictability does not mean
  intrinsic uncertainty. His other complaint was that Bohr was removing understanding
  from the field of physics. Bohr argued quite passionately that intuitive understanding
  was just not possible any more, and that you were old-fashioned if you insisted on
  it.</p>

  <p class="q2">And so mathematical description was substituted for
  understanding?</p>

  <p>Absolutely. It's conceptual nonsense. You can calculate stuff with
  the theory, but the words people put around it don't make any sense. That had the
  effect of driving the more conceptually-oriented students out of physics. We have ended
  up with more and more mathematicians in the physics departments. Don't get me wrong,
  there is nothing wrong with mathematics--it's the language we use to express the
  precise relations of physical law. But there is an increasing tendency to mistake the
  language for the physics itself. Once we lose the conceptual foundations, the whole
  thing becomes a shell game. There are very few conceptual workers left in the field.
  Feynman was one of the last ones, and he wasn't willing to take on the Copenhagen clan.
  Nobody was, until we come to A. O. Barut, John Dowling, John Cramer, and a few
  others.</p>

  <p class="q2">A lot of the trouble seems to came down to the idea of matter
  being composed of particles, rather than waves.</p>

  <p>Point particles got us into terrible trouble. If you take today's
  standard theory of particle physics, and the standard theory of gravitation, it is well
  known that the result is "off" by a factor of maybe ten to the power of 50. That's 10
  followed by 49 zeroes. The amount of matter in the universe is way, way more than what
  is observed. And that discrepancy comes, at its heart, from assuming that matter is
  made made up of point particles.</p>

  <p class="q2">What's the problem with them?</p>

  <p>Because point particles are assumed to occupy no space, they have to
  be accompanied by infinite charge density, infinite mass density, infinite energy
  density. Then these infinities get removed once more by something called
  "renormalization." It's all completely crazy. But our physics community has been
  hammering away at it for decades. Einstein called it Ptolemaic epicycles all over
  again.</p>

  <p class="q2">Hold on... epicycles?</p>

  <p>Ptolemaic astronomers assumed that the earth was at the center. But
  then it became more and more complex to calculate the orbits of visible planets. When
  you assume the earth is the center, you have to add epicycles to the existing orbits to
  adjust them. In the same way, when you assume photons are point particles, and all you
  can calculate is probability, you have to add epicycles of conceptual nonsense to
  "explain" even the simplest experiment.</p>

  <p class="q2">So when results don't fit theory...</p>

  <p>The theory has to be adjusted, with band-aids stuck on top of one
  another. This happens all the time with science, but especially with the statistical
  quantum theory. It takes enormous work to take that theory and work it into a form that
  is useful for anything except those questions that it was initially devised for. And
  the band-aid epicycles are then announced as a triumph for the theory. It's amazing how
  long they have gotten away with it.</p>

  <p class="q2">Is there a message in all this?</p>

  <p>What this is telling us is that we have simply not been thinking
  about it right. We have to start working through the whole subject again. And that is
  going to take real work. I've gotten a little start on various pieces of it. Barut and
  Dowling got some wonderful results with the hydrogen atom. But there's a whole lot more
  work to do.</p>

  <p class="q2">Running through your work is the idea that the deeper thing is
  probably simpler.</p>

  <p>It always worked out that when I understood something, it turned out
  to be simple. Take the connection between the quantum stuff and the electrodynamics in
  my book. It took me thirty years to figure out, and in the end, it was almost trivial.
  It's so simple that any freshman could read it and understand it. But it was hard for
  me to get there because all of this historical junk was in the way.</p>

  <p class="q2">Much has been made of the philosophical implications of quantum
  theory.</p>

  <p>Once Bohr and Heisenberg won the scientific debates, they went
  around pontificating about philosophy.</p>

  <p class="q2">What was the thrust?</p>

  <p>They said that if the quantum world is inherently uncertain, if the
  only information about basic physics is statistical, then we need to rethink our view
  of all of reality. In a way it was a throwback to the old arguments between science and
  religion. Newtonians used the ability to predict the planets' positions as a refutation
  of standard religion, which said, well, "God puts them where he wants and you have just
  have to have faith about that." Religion didn't need to take a stand against Newton,
  but it chose to, starting with Galileo. And this terrible polarization set in.</p>

  <p class="q2">So quantum theorists took us back to the unknowable, where
  things have to be taken on faith or on authority?</p>

  <p>Yes, but as we look out at the universe today, there's nothing that
  makes it anything but more awesome. In fact, as we look back at those pictures and we
  think, "Now how could anyone who had any deep sense of faith believe in a God that
  would make stars by punching little holes in a cardboard sky?"</p>

  <p class="q2">What was anti-religious about the Newtonian view? He was
  personally religious.</p>

  <p>Nothing, but his followers framed the issue as, "If you can predict
  it, that shows that religion is wrong." The quantum theorists reopened the question as
  "No, you can't predict it, because it's basically statistical."</p>

  <p class="q2">You could say that for some people, the predictability of nature
  undermined faith in God (although it needn't have done so). Quautum uncertainty
  undermined faith in science.</p>

  <p>I think Einstein was being a scientist in the truest sense in his
  response to the Copenhagen interpretation. He said that none of us would be scientists
  if deep down we didn't believe there is a set of regularities in the operation of
  physical law. That is a matter of faith. It is not something anybody has proven, but
  none of us would be scientists if we didn't have that faith.</p>

  <p class="q2">What you're saying is that in a rush to declare science
  complete, Bohr &amp; co. essentially defined away a key assumption of science?</p>

  <p>Faith in physics was undermined. Generations of students were
  basically driven out of physics because it was no longer comprehensible.</p>

  <p class="q2">While theory was ailing, though, people were devising all kinds
  of interesting experiments and practical devices.</p>

  <p>It was indeed a time of enlightenment for the experimental side--we
  had to go off and make our own picture of the world. We got ideas about what
  experiments would be interesting and went ahead with them. Tony Siegman's book Lasers
  is the definitive treatment of the device that underlies the whole field of fiber
  optics. He shows that the statistical quantum assumption just gets in the way. In an
  1,200-page tome, he hardly even mentions photons.</p>

  <p class="q2">What the reaction in the profession to what you are saying?</p>

  <p>People are trying to figure out what to make of it. People like the
  idea that there is a simpler way of thinking about this, but it's a lot to get your
  head around. The world is full of specialists nowadays, and there aren't that many
  people any more who try to understand large fractions of what physics is about. So it
  is going to take time for people to realize this is a much simpler way to teach
  physics, and that they can grasp a lot more of it than by today's method. And some
  people have said, "This is great--it never made any sense to me, which is why I quit
  being a physicist."</p>

  <p class="q2">You've crossed over into biology yourself--building silicon
  retinas and cochleas. And this is leading to some real
  revolutions--super-high-resolution cameras and hearing aids with greatly improved
  intelligibility. Can you tell us a bit about that?</p>

  <p>Sonic Innovations is a company whose hearing aid, for the first
  time, uses our full knowledge of the human auditory system.</p>

  <p class="q2">And Foveon, your camera outfit?</p>

  <p>Foveon is about making the finest photographic images that have ever
  been made. We have about 60 employees, some of the most creative people I have ever
  worked with. We've been making our own low-volume, high-end cameras for two years. Now,
  the technology is just beginning to go into name brand cameras. You will be amazed!</p>

  <p class="q2">Does it use coherence?</p>

  <p>Every semiconductor derives its properties from the coherent nature
  of the electrons in it. The Foveon sensor uses these properties in a more fundamental
  and powerful way than other photosensors.</p>

  <p class="q2">The computer industry has thrived by doing well what humans do
  badly, namely calculation. But computers seem to do badly what humans do well--speech,
  movement, perception.</p>

  <p>The effort to build neurally inspired hardware has been much heavier
  going than I thought.</p>

  <p class="q2">You write, "Biological solutions are many orders of magnitude
  more effective than those we've been able to implement using digital methods." You
  write about the fruit fly as an embarrassment, because its sensory abilities so vastly
  outstrip the most powerful computer. What's going on?</p>

  <p>The fly has an autonomous system that avoids being swatted. It has
  the ability to see and navigate and make decisions on millisecond time scales. We've
  never been able to make artificial vision systems that come within orders of magnitude
  of that, with all the computation we can throw at them.</p>

  <p class="q2">Why not?</p>

  <p>That's what I was trying to find out. It makes us look so stupid.
  And you don't get popular by saying that. But it's true. And the more we try, the more
  we realize it's a much harder problem than we thought. What is it about the way that
  the fly, or the cat, or the fish process their information that makes it so much more
  effective at computing these things? They use what seems like really slow, slimy
  computational material, and yet they perform miracles with tiny amounts of power, tiny
  amounts of space and in real time and very fast.</p>

  <p class="q2">What's the problem?</p>

  <p>We don't know how even to formulate that problem, and we've been
  working on it since the dawn of computing. Every time we get another order of magnitude
  in computing capability, somebody says, "Now we've got enough!" But we haven't begun to
  get it.</p>

  <p class="q2">It could be that when you find out what's really going on, you'd
  be even more in awe.</p>

  <p>As I have found out more about what's going on, I have become more
  in awe. I'm amazed, for example, by the chemical complexity of neurological processes.
  They're not just digital or analog--they're chemical and physical, with dimensions that
  we do not understand at all.</p>

  <p class="q2">Now if your faith is correct, behind that awesome complexity
  lies some simple set of rules. No?</p>

  <p>I think there are principles. And I think there are principles of
  computation that get us this exponential advantage, which don't have to do with whether
  you do it with chemicals or electronics.</p>

  <p class="q2">Are you saying, in effect, architectural principles?</p>

  <p>You bet. I thought many times that I was on the verge of getting a
  hold of one of those. I haven't been able to make a crisp statement of one yet, but I
  feel on the verge. Every time I talk to the biologists, I get all charged up again.</p>

  <p class="q2">Does biology have a problem analogous to the physics
  problem--lots of people barking up trees, and not many looking at the forest?</p>

  <p>Every scientific discipline does. Our establishment rewards that
  kind of behavior. It's very, very hard to ask the deeper questions, because you won't
  get tenure that way.</p>

  <p class="q2">For years, artificial intelligence research has pursued an
  approach that comes down to "If we can just write enough code, we can figure out how to
  make the thing do logic and how to solve problems..." It hasn't worked very well.</p>

  <p>I think it just totally failed. Those Al systems can't see. They
  can't hear. They can't act. And they can't learn. Looking at the principles used by
  living systems has been much more successful. There have been recent successes in
  recognizing faces, fingerprints, things like that. The best results I have seen in
  reverse-engineering the brain have been the auditory processors done by my friend and
  collaborator Lloyd Watts. He has made remarkable progress by working with auditory
  neurobiologists and realizing the architecture of a much more capable hearing system in
  computational form. That's one to watch.</p>

  <p class="q2">And vision?</p>

  <p>Silicon sensors have been built that can recognize motion. But to
  distinguish between a computer and a car--that is a really, really hard problem. And
  yet we do it effortlessly, and so do flies. So we don't really know how to ask the
  question yet.</p>

  <p class="q2">Sounds like the gluon researchers might be closer.</p>

  <p>Oh, I would say so. It's more likely that we will figure out first
  if there's missing matter in the universe. If so, what it is. And if not, what's wrong
  with the general theory of relativity. We'll figure that out before we figure out the
  brain. It's just a really hard problem.</p>

  <p class="q2">So we shouldn't expect machines to take over any time soon.</p>

  <p>Don't lose sleep over it. Anybody who says, "Oh my God. These things
  are going to take over!"--it is just so far from anything real. People don't even know
  where to put the decimal point.</p>

  <p class="q2">Do you have any thoughts about gravitation?</p>

  <p>Yes, I've been working on it quite actively. It's funny--the most
  common force, everyone experiences it, and we just have no clue. It's fascinating when
  you think about it. The two long-range forces that we have in nature are the
  electromagnetic force and the gravitational force. The first we understand better than
  anything in physics, and yet gravity--we basically have no clue what it is. It doesn't
  fit with any of the other theories. It just gets pasted on. It's really an acute
  embarrassment.</p>

  <p class="q2">So there are still lots of mysteries in nature.</p>

  <p>We are all just struggling our way in this wonderful realm of nature
  that we know really very little about. Feynman has this wonderful quote about how the
  "theory of gravity" once was that the planets were being carried along by a whole flock
  of invisible angels. Then we ended up with a theory that it is this force between two
  masses that pulls at right angles to the motion. So he said what we have done is we
  have gone back to the invisible angels except now they are pushing at a 90-degree angle
  to the motion.</p>

  <p class="q2">Not angels but angles...</p>

  <p>Once angels were the explanation, but now, for us, it is a "force,"
  or "field." But these are all constructs of the human mind to help us to work with and
  visualize the regularities of nature. When we grasp onto some regularity, we give it a
  name, and the temptation is always to think that we really understand it. But the truth
  is that we're still not even close. Isn't it wonderful that nature is like that? It
  would be so dreadful if nature were so dull that we, with our pathetic little
  prejudices, had it all figured out already.</p>
